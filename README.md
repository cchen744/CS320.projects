# Data Programming II – Project Portfolio

This repository contains all the projects completed for **CS320: Data Programming II**. These projects showcase practical applications of data science techniques, including web development, web scraping, machine learning, and data visualization.

Among the eight machine projects, the following five are especially noteworthy:

---

### MP4 – Graph Search & Web Scraping

This project combines graph search algorithms (BFS and DFS) with web scraping using the `selenium` module. We scraped structured data from a model website and conducted core data analysis.

**Main file:** [`scrape.py`](./projects/mp4/scrape.py)

---

### MP5 – Data Visualization & A/B Testing on the Web

We built an interactive website using `Flask` and implemented A/B testing to compare different design versions. The site visualizes data and evaluates which version performs best.

**Main file:** [`main.py`](./projects/mp5/main.py)

---

### MP7 – Wisconsin Census Data Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing Wisconsin Census data using geospatial and machine learning tools. We used `geopandas` for geographical plotting and applied regression models to evaluate performance.

**Main file:** [`mp7.ipynb`](./projects/mp7/mp7.ipynb)

---

### MP8 – Machine Learning Pipeline & Prediction

A comprehensive machine learning project utilizing `scikit-learn`. This project demonstrates how to build a predictive model using `Pipeline` and `LinearRegression`.

**Main file:** [`main.py`](./projects/mp8/main.py)
