This repository include all the projects I have done in data science programming II. 
These projects include the real adoptation of techniques like web designing, web scraping, data modeling with machine learning, data visualizaiton, etc. Among all 8 machine projects, I believe there are 4 projects especially noteworthy.

**MP4** is focused on incorporating graph search methods (BFS and DFS) with web scraping. Using *selenium* module, we managed to scrape all necessary data from the model website and eventually completed core data analysis.
